# Monikers
<a href="https://www.cmyk.games/products/monikers" target="_blank">Monikers</a> is a card game in which you guess an item lised on the card from a verbal  description or from gestures.  This is a digital adaptation of the physical card game.

### Gameplay
Players split into any number of teams of at least 2 poeple. Players will take turns describing the word(s) on the screen while their teammates guess the word. Once a teammate guesses the word, you proceed to the next word. Once the time runs out, the device is passed to the next team for a chance to guess. The round is complete once all the words have been guessed. The game is comprised of 3 rounds:
- Round 1: Use any words, sounds, or gestures.
- Round 2: Use only 1 word as a clue.
- Round 3: No words, just charades.

The team that guess the most cards after thhe 3 rounds wins thhe game.

### Alterations of the Physical Game
Cards are slightly different than in the physical game:

1. Cards change from day to day. The previous day's top 1,000 most viewed topics on Wikipedia will be randomly pulled for a chance to use in the game.  This achieves 2 things. One, an automated way to generate cards. And, two, keeps the cards relevant to current times.
2. There are no points assigned to cards. Every card is worth 1 point.
3. There is a setting to write your own cards instead of generating them from Wikipedia.
